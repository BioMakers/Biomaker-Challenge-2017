Biomaker Challenge is a four-month programme challenging interdisciplinary teams to build low-cost sensors and instruments for biology. From colorimeters to microfluidics and beyond, weâ€™re looking for frugal, open source and DIY approaches to biological experiments. **For more information on eligibility and making an application see the [SynBio SRI website](http://www.synbio.cam.ac.uk/biomakerchallenge).**

## Using github and keeping in touch

Github is the primary means of organising and documenting the projects, you will need to:
- [Sign up for an account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) - free and quick
- Familiarise yourself with how to create, edit and comment on [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
- Remember that all text formatting is done using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Once you're set there are two ways you can interact with other Challenge participants and the coordinating team:
- [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Biomaker-Challenge/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/Biomaker-Challenge/Lobby) - this is a chat room for asking quick questions and you will login using the same github account.
- Make comments on or raise an issue in this [main repository](https://github.com/BioMakers/Biomaker-Challenge-2017/issues) or any of the project repositories once created.

You can also email biomaker@hermes.cam.ac.uk

## Suggesting an idea

1. Add an issue to this repository ([instructions](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)) and tag it with the label 'idea' and any other relevant labels. 
2. Assign yourself to the issue and potential collaborators can add themselves as well so you get alerts about comments.
3. To edit the project description and add more details, either click the pencil to edit the initial issue or add a comment.

## Joining a team

1. Discuss with the contact person for an idea either via the relevant issue or by email (contact details or links to find them should be in the project description). 
2. Assign yourself to issues containing ideas you're interested in so you get updates on comments.
