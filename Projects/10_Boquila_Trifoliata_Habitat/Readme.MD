## Synopsis

Boquila Trifoliata, a cimber at home in the temperate rainforests of southern chile, exhibits an extraordinary version of leaf mimicry. When growing in close proximity to other plants in its natural habitat it is able to adopt the other plantsâ€™ leaf coloring, shape, and size without physical contact (Gianoli et al., 2014). Until now B. Trifoliata is the only plant showing this behavior and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Additionally, the leaf mimicry has only been observed in the wild and it is unclear whether B. trifoliata shows the same behavior in a laboratory environment. We propose to build a Biosensor that is able to monitor B. trifoliata growth under laboratory conditions to investigate this mechanism. To this end we will design a chamber with precise humidity and temperature and illumination controls in which B. trifoliata can grow isolated or in close proximity to other plants that are endemic to its natural habitat, as for example Rhaphithamnus spinosus. A better understanding of this mysterious mechanism will might yield significant advances in our understanding of how plants communicate.

## Software

Show how the software components (if any) of your project function as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Ideally, this should be pseudo code or an abstract text representation of your code.


## Hardware

Show how the hardware components (if any) of your project function as concisely as possible, including a short description of fabrication and assembly. Component suppliers and part numbers should be provided separately in a bill of materials.

## Installation

Provide instructions on usage 

## Maintenance and Testing Guide

Describe a test scheme and show how to run the tests with code and hardware configuration examples.
